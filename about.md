Hi! I'm learning modern programming languages and tools after spending almost 10 years programming in RPG, followed by about the same amount of time in an almost codeless wilderness.

I also know some Japanese, though not as much as I used to. I lived in Japan for 2 and a half years, both during college and after college. But, that was over 25 years ago.

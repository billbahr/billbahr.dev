title: My Programming Journey
---

Every programmer has a story about how they got into programming. This is mine.

My first programming class was in high school in the 80s using Pascal for a language. I was kind of into it, but I was also intimidated because all of my friends seemed to already know so much more and be able to do so much more with programming.
This made some sense because my friends were from big east coast cities with more resources and bigger nerd communities. Small town Nebraska life was not quite the same. I was discouraged and did not pursue programming any further at that point.

After trying other subjects in college and graduate school, I signed up for programming classes again in my late 20's. This time I absolutely loved it. I even enjoyed the subjects that nobody else did, like the 2 required COBOL classes. I was completely hooked.
